# About me

I like good words and I cannot lie. I also like solving complex problems, looking holistically at technical requirements and user needs, and applying context to numbers.

8+ years of writing experience, 5+ years in Tech and Product.

Hire me for who I am, not for whom you want me to be. It will benefit us both.

Before you read further, I need to warn you: I really like talking about myself. 

## Background

My whole life, I have always loved words. Reading, writing, talking, listening — the power that good words have is immense. I studied classics (Ancient Greek and Latin languages and literature) at Moscow State University, with a bit of a bonus of linguistics and Russian literature. The latter resulted in me presenting twice at the Tartu University conference for young researchers.

However instead of pursuing an academic career I went into journalism. Back in 2011 in Russia it was still possible to do good investigative journalism for a major independent media outlet, and not feel marginalised. I worked for Lenta.ru — the biggest and best independent news website at the time. I was focusing on educational policies and occasionally other social issues. My biggest pride is a [long read about Kurchatov Institute.](https://lenta.ru/articles/2013/09/12/physics/) But my most known work is probably uncovering [plagiarism and fraud](https://lenta.ru/articles/2012/11/27/andrdisser/) in dissertations by politicians and mid-level officials in education — before it became a politicised movement.

Anyhow, 2014 came, Crimea suddenly became Russian again, and my editor-in-chief was fired, and we all quit, kind of. David Remnick [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press) about it for The New Yorker at the time. 

Soon after I moved to the Netherlands, and after a couple of months of remote freelance work I ended up working in Tech for a corporation.

## Tech & Product

Starting as a UX Copywriter for Russian market, I got into the basics of online experimentation and nitty-gritty details of localisation and internationalisation pretty quick. I eventually moved to (unofficially) owning internal copy and translations tools and infrastructure, and ended my tenure at Booking.com as the first ever UX Copywriter for the in-house built Experiment Tool.

This experience can be divided in three main chapters: writing, localisation and product. I talk in details about it in corresponding sections of my website.

## Inclusion, mental health, labour law and ethics

These are the topics that are extremely dear and important to me. I have life long mild depression and anxiety, I have had a burnout with a painful reintegration, and I was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder as an adult. 

I have always been very outspoken about my experience. I really believe that talking about this shit helps others fo through their own issues, and makes the world a better place. 

I also have pretty strong personal ethics.  This is why I would never work for certain companies, Russia Today and Facebook at the front line of my no-no list. I respect the choice of people who decide to work for companies I deem unethical, that doesn’t make them bad people. I just cannot do it myself.

Combining these two traits, I was one of the elected members of 6th Dutch Works Council of Booking.com, an employee co-determination body that all the companies in the Netherlands above certain size have to establish.

During my time as a Works Council member, I got deep into Dutch labour law. I researched and educated my colleagues about various dismissal processes, employee rights during sick leave and other things. My crown jewel was writing and editing a 100+ pages long official response to request for advice for restructuring the company (6000+ people in the Netherlands).

As a result of said restructuring, I have left the company in December 2020 and has been enjoying my free life since.


## Arts and Crafts

When I was on burnout leave in 2018, I rediscovered my passion for crafts. First it was Lego, followed by cross-stiching and painting spaceship models, up to buying a sewing machine. I am not great at arts and crafts (what is patience?!), but I do enjoy it immensely, and it has extremely positive effect on my mental health.

Back in my teenage years, I knitted scraves for all my friends. Now, I am mostly doing crazy amount of watercolours and some oil paintings, nand slowly getting into digital drawing (I am a sucker for stickers!). No apartment is big enough for the product of my arts&crafts sessions, so I set up an etsy shop, and a separate instagram account. Maybe it will grow into something bigger, but for now it's a hobby  that helps me feel better. Hence the namer — Art vs Depression.

## Trivia

I am a trekkie, adult fan of Lego, and a slave to two cats. Currently I am into running (very slowly) and dancing ballet (extremely awkwardly).
