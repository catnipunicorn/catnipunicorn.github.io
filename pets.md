title: Pet Sticker Sheets
---

Meow. First, I made some stickers for my cat sitting clients. Then, I made stickers with my cats, and my husband immediately put them all on his laptop. Then, I made stickers for my mom, then for my friends, then I ran out of cats. 

# Commissions are open!

For 10 euro (plus postage cost), I will make you a sticker sheet with your pet. I'll need some photos and a couple of days. You can [contact](/contact.htm) me via any channel, or [commission me on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/catnipunicorn/commissions).


Here are some examples:
