Hi! My name is Anna, and I like cats, good words and weighted blankets. I dislike hypocrisy.

My background lies in in teaching, investigative journalism and classics. But for the past 10 years, I have been working in tech sector as a UX writer and product manager. I advocate for inclusion, especially on the neurodivesity front. I read legal documents for fun (my favourites are labour and immigration laws).

For six years, I worked at Booking.com as a UX writer, technical product manager and an elected member of Works Council.

Currently I am volunteeting with [VluchtelingenWerk](https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/), learning to [paint](https://www.instagram.com/art.vs.depression/) and open for new opportuninities.
