Hi! My name is Anna, and I like cats, good words, nail polish and weighted blankets. 

I am a seasoned (UX) writer, an experienced product manager, an aspiring artist and a neurodiversity advocate with background in teaching, investigative journalism and classics. 

If you want to talk about job opportunities, expat life, autism, Myceanean Greek or meaning of life, [drop me a line](/contact.html). As most people in 2022, I hate phone calls.
