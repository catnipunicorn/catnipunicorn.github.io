# About me

Portrait by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessandthepencil/?hl=en">Jess Sanders</a></div>

Hi! My name is Anna, and I like cats, good words and weighted blankets. I dislike hypocrisy.

My background lies in teaching, investigative journalism and classics. But for the past 10 years, I have been working in the tech sector as a UX writer and product manager. I advocate for inclusion, especially on the neurodivesity front. I read legal documents for fun (my favourite areas of the law are labour and immigration).

For six years, I worked at Booking.com as a UX writer, technical product manager and an elected member of the Works Council. I have a Professional Scrum Product Owner I [certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/4fb91bf0-172d-46dc-a65c-b752abc9146a).

Currently I am volunteering with [VluchtelingenWerk](https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/), learning to [paint](https://www.instagram.com/art.vs.depression/) and open for new (paid) opportunities. I also offer [catsitting services](https://en.pawshake.nl/petsitters/rotterdam/i-love-all-cats-and-i-cannot-lie-ZpkrEyRozf2) in Rotterdam, and make [various stickers](/stickers.html).

# Other work

- **News**. I worked with Lenta.ru (pre-2014) and Holod.media as a news editor. Monitoring sources (from official agencies to telegram channels), fact checking, prioritising, writing â€” and maintating balance between speed and quality.
- **Feature articles**. I worked with Lenta.ru (pre-2014), Holod.media and others and wrote on a variety of topics from education to maternity leave to TV shows to, of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- **Teaching**. Private language tutoring (Ancient Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish) and middle school (Latin and Classics).
- **Interpreting**. No way I am a professional, but I volunteer my language skills for refugees at VluchtelingenWerk.
