# CV
Download my fancy corporate ready CV as a .pdf [here](/assets/files/CV2021.pdf).

*TL;DR:* higher education in humanities, journalism career in Russia cut short because of censorship, a bit of freelancing, UX Writer and Product Manager at Booking.com in the Netherlands. I was an elected Works Council member during the COVID-related downsizing — and learned a lot about labour laws, corporate management and myself.


Since January 2021, I am exploring various options in a non-commital fashion. Inluding, but non limited to: painting, volunteering as an interpreter, going back to being a news editor, making this simple website.


# FAQ
The answers I often have to give at the first interview, the unfiltered version.

## So how did you move from UX writer to Product manager?
It just happened. Booking.com at some point followed a “bias to insource” principle. All the tools for writers and translators were made in-house. At some point I realised that they were not properly maintained, so I took the ownership. Eventually, I was acting as a Technical Product Manager for a team of 3 developers. I was leading integration of an internal application into a bigger one, and then a new roadmap for overhauling Booking.com copy & translation infrastructure and tooling. (My title was never formally changed).

## Why did you apply for the job at Our Glorious Company?
Because you don’t seem to be too evil, and I don’t seem to be too under- or overquaqified.

But  on a more serious note, the answer is — because I can imagine myself working for your company. You are not an oil company, not affiliated with crypto or Russian government, and not FAANG or Russia Today/Fox News/Daily Mail. 


## Why did you move to the Netherlands?
Why did _you_ move to the Netherlands? Why did you _not_ move outside of the Netherlands?

If you really want know, here you go.  In 2014, my then partner got offered a job at Booking.com as a developer. At the same time, I quit my job at the biggest independent online news media in Russia because our edior-in-chief [was fired](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press) and the media became pro-Kremlin. So, we relocated. Eventually I got a job at Booking.com, my then partner moved back to Russia, I stayed. Here I am now, with my Dutch citizenship.


## What is your favourite part of being a Product manager?
Getting paid. (Not really, actually, but it’s always nice; and the role is generally more respected and better paid than UX writing roles).

Being a PO/PM is like solving a puzzle, with a bunch of missing pieces and a bunch of pieces from other puzzles. You have your North Star, your vision, and then you have your reality — with customer needs and development resources. Throw in some historical decisions that made sense five years ago; immediate needs vs long term goal; all the different ideas your stakeholders have… And voilà — you have a brilliant puzzle to solve!

Getting the pieces together and navigating in the realm between the dream and reality is my favourite part of being a product owner.

## What are you looking for?
A job I will not [hate](https://theconversation.com/melly-shum-hates-her-job-but-europeans-love-this-work-by-canadian-artist-ken-lum-149120) after 6 months. 

Jokes aside — to learn from better and smarter people, to grow & be a better version of myself; to be recognised; to be able to pay my bills and buy more Lego sets (the best investment ever).

## Why did you leave Booking.com?

The company was going through [resctructuring](https://skift.com/2020/08/04/booking-com-restructuring-will-pare-its-workforce-by-up-to-25-percent/), and I was offered a nice voluntary leave package. It was too good not to take after 6 years in the same place. 

## I have another question.
