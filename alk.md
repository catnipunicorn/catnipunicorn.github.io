# ALK+ cancer research

Did you known that you don't have to be a smoker, passive or active, to get lung cancer in your early 30s? Well, now you do. Sometimes even lung cancer is just genetic, caused by mutation in ALK gene. It has no cure. 

[ALK Positive foundation](https://www.alkpositive.org/) brings patients, caregivers and medical professionals together to support each other and raise funds for research. If you [donate](https://alkpositive.kindful.com/) to their cause and send me a proof of your donation, I'll send you some [nice stickers](link) designed by Lara da Rocha Vaz Pato. Or you can buy the stickers from me, and I will donate all my net profit to ALK positive.

# Lara da Rocha Pato: the story behind the cause

In late 2019, a colleague approached me after I gave a talk about neurodiversity at work. Her name was Lara, she suspected she was autistic, and she wanted to chat about my experiences and office coping strategies. We had some coffee, and it was one of the best conversations I've had in a while.

In January 2020, before the pandemic came to Europe, Lara asked to have a chat again. She was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Genetic, uicurable, terminal. She [wrote](https://medium.com/@laradarocha) a lot about her experience.

At some point Lara started art therapy. She transformed her illness into beautiful watercolours, and the watercolours â€” into stickers. She opened a [RedBubble shop](https://www.redbubble.com/people/ducksrock/shop) with her design, donating all the money to ALK+ research.

In may 2022, Lara passed away.

We met only a total of four or five times, but we had such a good connection, and it sucks so much that we didn't have more time. I consider Lara a dear friend, and I want to continue raising awareness about ALK+ lung cancer, and to spread her art. With her partner's permission, I print stickers with her designs and give them out while telling Lara's story.
