  <h1 id="cv">CV</h1>
<p>Download my fancy corporate ready CV as a .pdf <a href="/assets/files/CV2021.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> higher education in humanities, journalism career in Russia cut short because of censorship, a bit of freelancing, UX Writer and Product Manager at Booking.com in the Netherlands. I was an elected Works Council member during the COVID-related downsizing — and learned a lot about labour laws, corporate management and myself.</p>

<p>Since January 2021, I am exploring various options in a non-commital fashion. Inluding, but non limited to: painting, volunteering as an interpreter, going back to being a news editor, making this simple website.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>The answers I often have to give at the first interview, the unfiltered version.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-did-you-move-from-ux-writer-to-product-manager">So how did you move from UX writer to Product manager?</h2>
<p>It just happened. Booking.com at some point followed a “bias to insource” principle. All the tools for writers and translators were made in-house. At some point I realised that they were not properly maintained, so I took the ownership. Eventually, I was acting as a Technical Product Manager for a team of 3 developers. I was leading integration of an internal application into a bigger one, and then a new roadmap for overhauling Booking.com copy &amp; translation infrastructure and tooling. (My title was never formally changed).</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-apply-for-the-job-at-our-glorious-company">Why did you apply for the job at Our Glorious Company?</h2>
<p>Because you don’t seem to be too evil, and I don’t seem to be too under- or overquaqified.</p>

<p>But  on a more serious note, the answer is — because I can imagine myself working for your company. You are not an oil company, not affiliated with crypto or Russian government, and not FAANG or Russia Today/Fox News/Daily Mail.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-move-to-the-netherlands">Why did you move to the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>Why did <em>you</em> move to the Netherlands? Why did you <em>not</em> move outside of the Netherlands?</p>

<p>If you really want know, here you go.  In 2014, my then partner got offered a job at Booking.com as a developer. At the same time, I quit my job at the biggest independent online news media in Russia because our edior-in-chief <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press">was fired</a> and the media became pro-Kremlin. So, we relocated. Eventually I got a job at Booking.com, my then partner moved back to Russia, I stayed. Here I am now, with my Dutch citizenship.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-favourite-part-of-being-a-product-manager">What is your favourite part of being a Product manager?</h2>
<p>Getting paid. (Not really, actually, but it’s always nice; and the role is generally more respected and better paid than UX writing roles).</p>

<p>Being a PO/PM is like solving a puzzle, with a bunch of missing pieces and a bunch of pieces from other puzzles. You have your North Star, your vision, and then you have your reality — with customer needs and development resources. Throw in some historical decisions that made sense five years ago; immediate needs vs long term goal; all the different ideas your stakeholders have… And voilà — you have a brilliant puzzle to solve!</p>

<p>Getting the pieces together and navigating in the realm between the dream and reality is my favourite part of being a product owner.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-looking-for">What are you looking for?</h2>
<p>A job I will not <a href="https://theconversation.com/melly-shum-hates-her-job-but-europeans-love-this-work-by-canadian-artist-ken-lum-149120">hate</a> after 6 months.</p>

<p>Jokes aside — to learn from better and smarter people, to grow &amp; be a better version of myself; to be recognised; to be able to pay my bills and buy more Lego sets (the best investment ever).</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-leave-bookingcom">Why did you leave Booking.com?</h2>

<p>The company was going through <a href="https://skift.com/2020/08/04/booking-com-restructuring-will-pare-its-workforce-by-up-to-25-percent/">resctructuring</a>, and I was offered a nice voluntary leave package. It was too good not to take after 6 years in the same place.</p>
