<h1 id="cv">CV</h1>
<p>Download my fancy corporate ready CV (general version) as a .pdf <a href="/assets/files/CV2021.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR: higher education in humanities, journalism career in Russia cut short because of censorship, a bit of freelancing, UX Writer and (acting) Product Owner at Booking.com in the Netherlands.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>The answers I have to give at the first interview, the unfiltered version.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-did-you-move-from-ux-writer-to-product-owner">So how did you move from UX writer to Product Owner?</h3>
<p>It just happened. At Booking.com, back in the day, we followed a “bias to insource” principle. All the tools for writers and translators were made in-house. At some point I’ve realised that they are not properly maintained, so I took the ownership.  Eventually, I was acting as a Technical Product Owner for a team of 3 developers, leading first integration of one internal application into a bigger one, and then a new roadmap for overhauling Booking.com copy &amp; translation infrastructure and tooling. (My title was never formally changed).</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-apply-for-the-job-in-our-glorious-company">Why did you apply for the job in Our Glorious Company?</h3>
<p>Because you don’t seem to be too evil, and I don’t seem to be too underquaqified.</p>

<p>But  on a more serious note, unless you are Mozilla, World Press Photo or a tiny non-profit working on immigration policies, the answer is — because I can imagine myself working it your company. You are not a huge soulless corporation, but also not a startup that doesn’t know what they are doing. You are not an oil company, not a  fintech, and not FANG (really, I’d love to talk to Facebook recruiters and ask them a couple of questions about what they seen the mirror!) or Russia Today/Fox News/Daily Mail.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can give a more specific answer, like, I really liked that part of the job description, or you are in the sustainability business, or you are a B.Corp.  Or something.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-move-to-the-netherlands">Why did you move to the Netherlands?</h3>
<p>How does it affect my ability to perform the job and/or be a part of the team? Why did you move to the Netherlands? Why did you not move outside of the Netherlands?</p>

<p>If you really want know, here you go.  In 2014, my then partner got offered a job at Booking.com as a developer. At the same time, I quit my job at the biggest independent online news media in Russia because our edior-in-chief <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press">was fired</a> and the media became pro-Kremlin. So, we moved. Eventually I myself got a job at Booking.com, my then partner moved back to Russia, I stayed. Here I am now, with my permanent EU residence permit, thinking if I should apply for Dutch citizenship.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-your-favourite-part-of-being-a-product-owner">What is your favourite part of being a Product Owner?</h3>
<p>Getting paid. (Not really, actually, but it’s always nice; and the role is generally more respected and better paid than UX roles).</p>

<p>Being a PO is like solving a puzzle, with a bunch of missing pieces and a bunch of pieces from other puzzles. You have your North Star, your vision, and then you have your reality — with customer needs and development resources. Throw in some historical decisions that made sense five years ago; immediate needs vs long term goal; all the different ideas your stakeholders have… And voila — you have a brilliant puzzle to solve!</p>

<p>Getting the pieces together and navigating in the realm between the dream and reality is my favourite part of being a product owner.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-you-looking-for">What are you looking for?</h3>
<p>A job I will not <a href="https://theconversation.com/melly-shum-hates-her-job-but-europeans-love-this-work-by-canadian-artist-ken-lum-149120">hate</a> after 6 months.</p>

<p>Look, I don’t know what exactly I am looking for. I only know what I don’t want.</p>

<p>I don’t want to have to justify to myself every day why am I working at your company; I want it to align with my values, at least to some degree.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be the most senior person in the room for any topic; yes, I have my expertise, experience, skills, knowledge etc, but you should also bring something to the table.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be micromanaged, or to be a tiny  cogwheel in a huge machine. I don’t want to guess what the founder actually wants either. I need some guidance and direction, but I also need some freedom.</p>

<p>At the end, I want the same any other human wants. To grow &amp; be a better version of myself; to be recognised; to be able to pay my bills and my Lego sets the best investment ever).</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-leave-bookingcom">Why did you leave Booking.com?</h3>

<p>The company was going through <a href="https://skift.com/2020/08/04/booking-com-restructuring-will-pare-its-workforce-by-up-to-25-percent/">resctructuring</a>, and I was offered a nice voluntary leave package. It was too good not to take after 6 years in the same place.</p>
