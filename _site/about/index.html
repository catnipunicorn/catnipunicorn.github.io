<p>I like good words and I cannot lie. I also like solving complex problems, looking holistically at technical requirements and user needs, and applying context to numbers.</p>

<p>8+ years of writing experience, 5+ years in Tech and Product.</p>

<p>Hire me for who I am, not for whom you want me to be. It will benefit us both.</p>

<p>Before you read further, I need to warn you: I really like talking about myself.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My whole life, I have always loved words. Reading, writing, talking, listening — the power that good words have is immense. I studied classics (Ancient Greek and Latin languages and literature) at Moscow State University, with a bit of a bonus of linguistics and Russian literature. The latter resulted in me presenting twice at the Tartu University conference for young researchers.</p>

<p>However instead of pursuing an academic career I went into journalism. Back in 2011 in Russia it was still possible to do good investigative journalism for a major independent media outlet, and not feel marginalised. I worked for Lenta.ru — the biggest and best independent news website at the time. I was focusing on educational policies and occasionally other social issues. My biggest pride is a <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2013/09/12/physics/">long read about Kurchatov Institute.</a> But my most known work is probably uncovering <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2012/11/27/andrdisser/">plagiarism and fraud</a> in dissertations by politicians and mid-level officials in education — before it became a politicised movement.</p>

<p>[photo goes here]</p>

<p>Anyhow, 2014 came, Crimea suddenly became Russian again, and my editor-in-chief was fired, and we all quit, kind of. David Remnick <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press">wrote</a> about it for The New Yorker at the time.</p>

<p>Soon after I moved to the Netherlands, and after a couple of months of remote freelance work I ended up working in Tech for a corporation.</p>

<h2 id="tech--product">Tech &amp; Product</h2>

<p>Starting as a UX Copywriter for Russian market, I got into the basics of online experimentation and nitty-gritty details of localisation and internationalisation pretty quick. I eventually moved to (unofficially) owning internal copy and translations tools and infrastructure, and ended my tenure at Booking.com as the first ever UX Copywriter for the in-house built Experiment Tool.</p>

<p>This experience can be divided in three main chapters: writing, localisation and product. I talk in details about it in corresponding sections of my website.</p>

<h2 id="inclusion-mental-health-labour-law-and-ethics">Inclusion, mental health, labour law and ethics</h2>

<p>These are the topics that are extremely dear and important to me. I have life long mild depression and anxiety, I have had a burnout with a painful reintegration, and I was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder as an adult.</p>

<p>I have always been very outspoken about my experience. I really believe that talking about this shit helps others fo through their own issues, and makes the world a better place.</p>

<p>I also have pretty strong personal ethics.  This is why I would never work for certain companies, Russia Today and Facebook at the front line of my no-no list. I respect the choice of people who decide to work for companies I deem unethical, that doesn’t make them bad people. I just cannot do it myself.</p>

<p>Combining these two traits, I was one of the elected members of 6th Dutch Works Council of Booking.com, an employee co-determination body that all the companies in the Netherlands above certain size have to establish.</p>

<p>[another photo goes here]</p>

<p>During my time as a Works Council member, I got deep into Dutch labour law. I researched and educated my colleagues about various dismissal processes, employee rights during sick leave and other things. My crown jewel was writing and editing a 100+ pages long official response to request for advice for restructuring the company (6000+ people in the Netherlands).</p>

<p>As a result of said restructuring, I have left the company in December 2020 and has been enjoying my free life since.</p>

<h2 id="arts-and-crafts">Arts and Crafts</h2>

<p>When I was on burnout leave in 2018, I rediscovered my passion for crafts. First it was Lego, followed by cross-stiching and painting spaceship models, up to buying a sewing machine. I am not great at arts and crafts (what is patience?!), but I do enjoy it immensely, and it has extremely positive effect on my mental health.</p>

<p>Back in my teenage years, I knitted scraves for all my friends. Now, I am mostly doing crazy amount of watercolours and some oil paintings, nand slowly getting into digital drawing (I am a sucker for stickers!). No apartment is big enough for the product of my arts&amp;crafts sessions, so I set up an etsy shop, and a separate instagram account. Maybe it will grow into something bigger, but for now it’s a hobby  that helps me feel better. Hence the namer — Art vs Depression.</p>

<p>[she’s making jewellery now]</p>

<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>

<p>I am a trekkie, adult fan of Lego, and a slave to two cats. Currently I am into running (very slowly) and dancing ballet (extremely awkwardly).</p>
