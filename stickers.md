# Stickers

I have always loved stickers. Stickers make boring things, like your work laptop or a lamp post, much more fun. For my birthday, I got Silhouette Portrait 3 — a cutting machine — to be able to make my own stickers at home. 

If you would like to collaborate, commission me, but existing ones or just have your design printed-and-cut on a nice sticker paper, [drop me a line](contact.html)!


## WordCloud.app collaboration

My dear friend [Elena](https://smartpuffin.com/) is founder of [WordCloud.app](https://wordcloud.app/) — an app that puts your words into shape. I made a bunch of die-cut stickers for her, and a small sticker sheet.

## Cats! Cats! Cats!

I love all cats and I cannot lie. Which is why I made sticker sheet with my cats...

I also made similar stickers for my mom, some of my friends and my cat-sitting clients. Read more [here](/pets.html).
