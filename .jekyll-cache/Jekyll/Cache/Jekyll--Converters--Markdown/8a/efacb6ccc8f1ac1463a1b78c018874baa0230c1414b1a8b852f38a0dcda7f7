<p>Hi! My name is Anna, and I like cats, good words, nail polish and weighted blankets.</p>

<p>I am a seasoned (UX) writer, an experienced product manager, an aspiring artist and a neurodiversity advocate with background in teaching, investigative journalism and classics.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about job opportunities, expat life, autism, Myceanean Greek or meaning of life, <a href="/contact.html">drop me a line</a>. As most people in 2022, I hate phone calls.</p>
