<p>â€œJerks, not autisticâ€ is a pure rage-driven website.</p>

<h3 id="the-story">The story</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, on a Sunday morning I woke up and read in the news that Elon Musk thinks having Aspergerâ€™s is an excuse to be a terrible human being. (Donâ€™t get me wrong, I think he is a genius, and I respect a lot about him and his work â€” but he still is a terrible human being.)</p>

<p>The story reminded me about â€œthe Google memo guyâ€ who used the same excuse to be a pathetic misogynist. I even wrote a twitter thread on the topic!</p>

<p>But on that Sunday morning, my humble twitter with barely 100 followers was not enough. I needed something better. Something bigger to channel my anger. So I thought there should be a list calling out people like Elon Musk who use autism spectrum disorder to justify their jerkiness. Once I was done with my breakfast, I ran to my laptop and built a website.</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The process</h3>

<p>I used WIX because I wanted to get shit done fast. I played around with it earlier but eventually realised I canâ€™t do a personal business-card-style website in any of those builders. I just canâ€™t go with visuals first. However, for a simple list of names and links (and a bit of extra text) WIX was a perfect solution.</p>

<p>I built <a href="https://www.jerksnotautistic.com/">Jerks, not autistic</a> in about 3 hours. Most of that time I spent writing/researching content and dealing with payments.</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>

<p>For once, I used my anger to do something productive! The traffic for <a href="https://www.jerksnotautistic.com/">Jerks, not autistic</a> is almost non existent, and I donâ€™t really work on promoting it. My goal was to just create something in the heat of the moment â€” and I consider it a success.</p>
