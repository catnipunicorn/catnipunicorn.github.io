# About
Hi, my name is Anna, and I don’t have a catchy line.

I am smart. I am going to be honest with you, and challenge the hell out of your believes. I will ask you the right questions, and help you get to the answers.

In my heart, I am a writer. But — I’m not a native English speaker, and I will never get to the native level, especially with all these articles.

Nonetheless, a lot of my skills are not language bound. 

I am a storyteller. I can define your narrative, and help you build it — you can then translate it in any language.

I am a problem solver. Give me a puzzle and I will not stop until I get to the solution.

I am an investigator. I will not bore you with my accomplishments in Russian media 10 years ago, but I will give you an example of my recent work… who am I kidding, it’s not work, I just wanted to get a decent Secret Santa gift to my coleague. Knowing where she spent her teenage years was not very relevant.
