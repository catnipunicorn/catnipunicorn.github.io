# FAQ
The answers I have to give at the first interview, the unfiltered version.

### So how did you move from UX writer to Product Owner?
It just happened. At Booking.com, back in the day, we followed a “bias to insource” principle. All the tools for writers and translators were made in-house. At some point I’ve realised that they are not properly maintained, so I took the ownership.  Eventually, I was acting as a Technical Product Owner for a team of 3 developers, leading first integration of one internal application into a bigger one, and then a new roadmap for overhauling Booking.com copy & translation infrastructure and tooling. (My title was never formally changed).

### Why did you apply for the job in Our Glorious Company?
Because you don’t seem to be too evil, and I don’t seem to be too underquaqified.

But  on a more serious note, unless you are Mozilla, World Press Photo or a tiny non-profit working on immigration policies, the answer is — because I can imagine myself working it your company. You are not a huge soulless corporation, but also not a startup that doesn’t know what they are doing. You are not an oil company, not a  fintech, and not FANG (really, I’d love to talk to Facebook recruiters and ask them a couple of questions about what they seen the mirror!) or Russia Today/Fox News/Daily Mail. 

Sometimes I can give a more specific answer, like, I really liked that part of the job description, or you are in the sustainability business, or you are a B.Corp.  Or something.

### Why did you move to the Netherlands?
How does it affect my ability to perform the job and/or be a part of the team? Why did you move to the Netherlands? Why did you not move outside of the Netherlands?

If you really want know, here you go.  In 2014, my then partner got offered a job at Booking.com as a developer. At the same time, I quit my job at the biggest independent online news media in Russia because our edior-in-chief [was fired](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-moves-against-the-press) and the media became pro-Kremlin. So, we moved. Eventually I myself got a job at Booking.com, my then partner moved back to Russia, I stayed. Here I am now, with my permanent EU residence permit, thinking if I should apply for Dutch citizenship.


### What is your favourite part of being a Product Owner?
Getting paid. (Not really, actually, but it’s always nice; and the role is generally more respected and better paid than UX roles).

Being a PO is like solving a puzzle, with a bunch of missing pieces and a bunch of pieces from other puzzles. You have your North Star, your vision, and then you have your reality — with customer needs and development resources. Throw in some historical decisions that made sense five years ago; immediate needs vs long term goal; all the different ideas your stakeholders have… And voila — you have a brilliant puzzle to solve!

Getting the pieces together and navigating in the realm between the dream and reality is my favourite part of being a product owner.

### What are you looking for?
A job I will not [hate](https://theconversation.com/melly-shum-hates-her-job-but-europeans-love-this-work-by-canadian-artist-ken-lum-149120) after 6 months. 

Look, I don’t know what exactly I am looking for. I only know what I don’t want.  

I don’t want to have to justify to myself every day why am I working at your company; I want it to align with my values, at least to some degree. 

I don’t want to be the most senior person in the room for any topic; yes, I have my expertise, experience, skills, knowledge etc, but you should also bring something to the table.  

I don’t want to be micromanaged, or to be a tiny  cogwheel in a huge machine. I don’t want to guess what the founder actually wants either. I need some guidance and direction, but I also need some freedom.

At the end, I want the same any other human wants. To grow & be a better version of myself; to be recognised; to be able to pay my bills and my Lego sets (the best investment ever).

### Why did you leave Booking.com?

The company was going through [resctructuring](https://skift.com/2020/08/04/booking-com-restructuring-will-pare-its-workforce-by-up-to-25-percent/), and I was offered a nice voluntary leave package. It was too good not to take after 6 years in the same place.
