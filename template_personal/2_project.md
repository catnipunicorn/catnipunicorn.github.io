## Jerks, not autistic

"Jerks, not autistic" is a pure rage-driven website.

### The story

Once upon a time, on a Sunday morning I woke up and read in the news that Elon Musk thinks having Asperger's is an excuse to be a terrible human being. (Don't get me wrong, I think he is a genius, and I respect a lot about him and his work — but he still is a terrible human being.)

The story reminded me about "the Google memo guy" who used the same excuse to be a pathetic misogynist. I even wrote a twitter thread on the topic!

But on that Sunday morning, my humble twitter with barely 100 followers was not enough. I needed something better. Something bigger to channel my anger. So I thought there should be a list calling out people like Elon Musk who use autism spectrum disorder to justify their jerkiness. Once I was done with my breakfast, I ran to my laptop and built a website.

### The process

I used WIX because I wanted to get shit done fast. I played around with it earlier but eventually realised I can't do a personal business-card-style website in any of those builders. I just can't go with visuals first. However, for a simple list of names and links (and a bit of extra text) WIX was a perfect solution.

I built [Jerks, not autistic](https://www.jerksnotautistic.com/) in about 3 hours. Most of that time I spent writing/researching content and dealing with payments.

### The result

For once, I used my anger to do something productive! The traffic for [Jerks, not autistic](https://www.jerksnotautistic.com/) is almost non existent, and I don't really work on promoting it. My goal was to just create something in the heat of the moment — and I consider it a success.
